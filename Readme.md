# Interactive Photo Gallery - example

For this HTML project, we’re going to mix in a little bit of JavaScript to create an interactive photo gallery that’s ideal for a photography website.

Yep, your website will allow users to click on thumbnails in an album to view a larger version of an image.

While I know this article is about HTML, as you become more experienced and skilled, you need to know how to integrate JavaScript with HTML.

I don’t make the rules; this is just how things are with modern web development!

But don’t worry, this is only going to be a light sprinkling of JS. If you want to level up your skills in that area, I’d definitely consider a JavaScript course.

That said, let’s take a look at the skills you’ll be using to build this HTML project: 

- HTML5: Use HTML5 semantic tags to structure your photo gallery.
- CSS3: Use CSS3 for styling and creating grid layouts.
- JavaScript: Use basic JavaScript to handle click events and manipulate the DOM.
- Lightbox Feature: Create a lightbox effect to view pictures. This involves dimming the rest of the webpage and displaying a selected image in a larger size.
- Responsive Design: Create a responsive gallery that looks good on all screen sizes.

Like we’ve done so far in this article, this project has been designed to be a natural step up from those before it.

If you’re not sure whether you’re ready, consider checking out the earlier options in the list to refresh your HTML skills.

Otherwise, dive into the HTML and CSS source code below. 

Notice how we’ve implemented a longer CSS stylesheet here, as we’re not depending on a CSS framework for this project.

We’ve also included a JavaScript file that will house all of the JavaScript functions that our project needs to activate the interactive lightbox features.

This allows us to show a contrasting backdrop and an enlarged image. 

You should also be able to notice the use of event handlers for onClick, which is where we’re calling our JavaScript functions.

This is fairly standard but may be new to you if you’ve not used JS before.

As always, feel free to get creative and experimental with this project to see how it all works. 

And why not try to break stuff and see if you can fix it? I’ve found that can be an excellent way to test my own understanding of what’s going on.
